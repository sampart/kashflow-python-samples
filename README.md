# Python Kashflow samples

Simple [Kashflow](https://www.kashflow.com/) integration examples for Python, which I wrote back in 2012 during a brief stint at [Green Accountancy](http://www.greenaccountancy.com).

* `simple-kashflow-sample.py` is extremely simple.  It just connects to Kashflow and prints out a list of customers with rudimentary formatting.
* `poc.py` is slightly more complicated – it connects to Kashflow, retrieves details of the client’s first bank account and then outputs all bank transactions to a CSV file.

_Code samples for other languages are available on the [Kashflow website](https://www.kashflow.com/developers/developer-resources/), but that page doesn't include Python._
